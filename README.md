This project addresses a supervised machine learning classification problem. The objective is to classify individuals based on their daily water intake level using personal and lifestyle-related features such as age, gender, weight, and physical activity. The target variable represents the daily water intake category, and the model is expected to learn patterns that distinguish between different intake levels.
